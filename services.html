    When you are stuck trying to develop content, a good starting place is to ask what it is exactly that your audience wants to know. After all, your products and services should act as a solution to their needs. Yet, do not leave your products and services as stand-alone documents, answer the questions that your customers are asking.</p>
<p>A really great way to do this is to have a creative Q & A section. You can either develop these questions (and answers) yourself based on what people ask you and your sales team the most, or you can actually turn to social media and emails where people have explicitly asked your product and service related questions.</p>
<p>In any case, developing content around this notion of product Q&A will show your ability to anticipate the needs of your customers, but it will also give you an interface that you can constantly update, change, and revise for fresh content.

    Below is an example from QA Flooring </p>

        Create a sense of urgency
Creating a sense of urgency with content on a product/service page is a balancing act. On the one hand, you don’t want a buyer to think that a product they fall in love with is going to go away out of the blue once they purchase; but on the other hand you don’t want them to wait to purchase your product or sign up for the service.

One of the ways you can create a sense of urgency is by making sure that you utilise content on these pages to send that message.

Develop content that is going to get visitors hooked and also feel the need to buy or sign-up ASAP. There are a variety of ways to do this: promotions, monthly offers, showcased products, all of which involve creatively developing content which can be updated on a regular basis!

The example below from Shoedazzle shows how they used a monthly offer to help keep visitors hooked with their content:
